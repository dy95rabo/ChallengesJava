     * Difference Cipher
     * 
     * It's time to send and receive secret messages.
     * 
     * Create two functions that take a string and an array and returns a coded or
     * decoded message.
     * 
     * The first letter of the string, or the first element of the array represents
     * the Character Code of that letter. The next elements are the differences
     * between the characters: e.g. A +3 --> C or z -1 --> y.
     * Examples
     * 
     * encrypt("Hello") ➞ [72, 29, 7, 0, 3]
     * // H = 72, the difference between the H and e is 29 (upper- and lowercase).
     * // The difference between the two l's is obviously 0.
     * 
     * decrypt([ 72, 33, -73, 84, -12, -3, 13, -13, -68 ]) ➞ "Hi there!"
     * 
     * encrypt("Sunshine") ➞ [83, 34, -7, 5, -11, 1, 5, -9]
     * 
     * Notes
     * 
     * The input of the encrypt function will always be a string.
     * The input of the decrypt function will always be an array with numbers.
